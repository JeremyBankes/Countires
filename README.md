| An outline of a country will be shown to you. <br> Your job is to identify what country you're looking at. <br> If you guess the correct country, you will be awarded points based on how many guesses it took you. <br> If you guess an incorrect country, you will be shown an arrow and a distance pointing from the country you guessed towards the country you've been shown. | If you are unsure which country you are looking at, it's a good idea to narrow down your possibilities by guessing a country you think may be in the vicinity! <br> You can start typing a country name and use the auto-complete suggestions to find the country you're looking for! |


This game is constructed from scratch using my suite of open source lucania-software libraries.
It uses Lux for the aesthetics. Vision is used for DOM manipulation to add dynamism to the page.
Thank you to the third party services Country Flags, Font Awesome and Google Fonts for providing the icons and fonts used in this project!
This project was written in TypeScript and transpiled into JavaScript using the rollup.js module bundler.
